module:
  reverb_room:
    room_size:
      type: float
      help: How big the room is as a proportion of max_room_size. This sets delay line lengths and must be between 0 and 1.
    feedback:
      type: int32_t
      help: feedback gain in Q0.31 format. Feedback can be calculated from decay as `(0.28 decay) + 0.7`. Use the function ``adsp_reverb_calculate_feedback`` in ``control/reverb.h``.
    damping:
      type: int32_t
      help: High frequency attenuation in Q0.31 format. Use the function ``adsp_reverb_calculate_damping`` in ``control/reverb.h``. 
    wet_gain:
      type: int32_t
      help: Gain applied to the wet signal in Q0.31 format. Use the function ``adsp_reverb_db2int`` in ``control/reverb.h``. Alternatively, both wet and dry gains can be obtained from ``adsp_reverb_wet_dry_mix``.
    dry_gain:
      type: int32_t
      help: Dry signal gain in Q0.31 format. Use the function ``adsp_reverb_db2int`` in ``control/reverb.h``. Alternatively, both wet and dry gains can be obtained from ``adsp_reverb_wet_dry_mix``.
    pregain:
      type: int32_t
      help: The pregain applied to the signal before the reverb. Changing this value is not recommended. Use the function ``adsp_reverb_float2int`` in ``control/reverb.h``.
    predelay:
      type: uint32_t
      help: Predelay applied to the wet channel in samples. To convert a value in other units of time to samples, use ``time_to_samples`` in ``control/signal_chain.h``.
    width:
      type: float
      help: how wide the room is
