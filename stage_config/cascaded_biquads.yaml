        The coefficient shift applied to the output of each biquad in the cascade.
        The shifts should be in the same format as specified in the individual
        biquad.

        The normalised biquad filter coefficients for each biquad in the
        cascade as an array of [5][8], with 5 coefficients for up to 8
        biquads. The coefficients should be in the same format as
        specified in the individual biquad.
