  reverb_room:
    sampling_freq:
      type: uint32_t
      help: The sampling frequency of the reverb, can only be set at initialisation.
    max_room_size:
      type: float
      help: Sets the maximum size of the delay buffers, can only be set at initialisation.
    room_size:
      type: float
      help: How big the room is as a proportion of max_room_size. This sets delay line lengths and must be between 0 and 1.
    feedback:
      type: int32_t
      help: feedback gain in Q0.31 format. Feedback can be calculated from decay as `(decay * 0.28) + 0.7`.
    damping:
      type: int32_t
      help: High frequency attenuation in Q0.31 format.
    wet_gain:
      type: int32_t
      help: Gain applied to the wet signal in Q0.31 format
    dry_gain:
      type: int32_t
      help: Dry signal gain in Q0.31 format.
    pregain:
      type: int32_t
      help: The pregain applied to the signal before reverb. Changing this value is not recommended.
