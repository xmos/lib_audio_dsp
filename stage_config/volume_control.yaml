      help: >
        The target gain of the volume control in Q_GAIN format. To convert a value in decibels to
        this format, the function ``adsp_dB_to_gain`` in ``control/signal_chain.h``
        can be used.

        The current applied gain of the volume control in Q_GAIN format. 
        The volume control will slew the applied gain towards the target gain.
