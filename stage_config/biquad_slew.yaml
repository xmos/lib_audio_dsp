      help: >
        The number of bits to shift the output left by, in order to compensate for any right shift
        applied to the biquad b coefficients.
    filter_coeffs:
      type: int32_t
      size: 5
      attribute: DWORD_ALIGNED
      help: >
        The normalised biquad filter coefficients, in the order `[b0, b1, b2, -a1, -a2]/a0`. The
        coefficients should be in Q1.30 format. If the maximum b coefficient magnitude is greater
        than 2.0, the b coefficients should be right shifted to fit in Q1.30 format, and the shift
        value passed as left_shift to correct the gain after filtering. Biquad coefficients can be
        generated using the helper functions in ``control/biquad.h``.

    slew_shift:
      type: int
      help: >
        The shift value used to set the slew rate. See the biquad slew
        control documentation for conversions between slew_shift and
        time constant.
