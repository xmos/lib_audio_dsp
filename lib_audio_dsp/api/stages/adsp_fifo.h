// Very simple FIFO designed to provide channel-like API with asychronous comms.
//
// This is single-producer, single-consumer FIFO. The assumption is that the producer
// will have 1 or more things to send to the receiver in a transation. The producer
// can therefore call write multiple times before finishing the transaction. The consumer
// will be blocked until the producer has completed a transaction and will then be able
// to read from the FIFO.
//
// This FIFO also uses a channel to notify the consumer that there is data available.
// This is to allow the consumer to have a select case which is activated by the FIFO.
//
// To do this select on the `rx_end` member of adsp_fifo_t.
