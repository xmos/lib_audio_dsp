remedy under this Agreement or by law is only effective if given in
writing and shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or

provided under this Agreement or by law shall not constitute a waiver of
that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it prevent or restrict any
further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. No single or
partial exercise of any right or remedy provided under this Agreement or

notice or its designated recipient by informing the other party in
writing of such change. The parties shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any disputes.

Any dispute relating to the performance by either party of its
obligations under this Agreement (but excluding any dispute regarding
breach of confidentiality or which may require injunctive relief below)
shall be referred in the first instance to the CEO or a designated
management representative of each party for resolution. If the CEO’s or
designated management representatives cannot reach a mutually acceptable
resolution within 14 days of referral, the dispute may be referred to
arbitration at the agreement of the parties. To the extent that a breach
of this Agreement by Licensee may result in irreparable damage to XMOS
or its licensors, where XMOS and/or its licensors will not have an
adequate remedy at law, in addition to any other remedies and damages
available, Licensee acknowledges and agrees that XMOS and/or its
licensors may immediately seek enforcement of this Agreement by means of
specific performance or injunction.

Licensee shall comply (and shall procure that all Users shall comply)
with all national, state, and local laws and regulations governing the
use of the Software in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. XMOS
shall not be held liable to Licensee for any failure to fulfil its
obligations under this Agreement, if such failure is due to acts of God,
acts of civil or military authorities, fire or flood, epidemic war,
extreme weather or other natural calamity, acts of governmental agencies
or any other acts caused beyond the reasonable control of XMOS.

If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such finding shall
not affect the remainder of this Agreement which shall remain in full
force and effect as if the provision(s) determined to be invalid or
unenforceable had not been a part of this Agreement. In the event of
such finding of invalidity or unenforceability, the parties will
substitute forthwith the invalid, or unenforceable provision(s) by such
effective provision(s) as will most closely correspond with the original
intention of the provision(s) so voided. No delay or failure of either
party to enforce any right or provision under this Agreement shall
constitute a waiver of such right or of or any other right under this
Agreement. Licensee agrees that XMOS shall, on 5 business days’ notice,
be entitled to carry out an audit of Licensee’s and any Users compliance
with the terms of this Agreement and Licensee agrees to reasonably
cooperate (and procure that all Users reasonably cooperate) with XMOS
during such audits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, (a) XMOS may only carry out such an audit once in any 12-month
period during the term of this Agreement, (b) such audit shall be
limited to only such documentation as is reasonably related to Licensee
and any Users compliance with this Agreement. This Agreement, its
subject matter and its formation, are governed by English law. XMOS and

jurisdiction in the event of any dispute relating to this Agreement.
