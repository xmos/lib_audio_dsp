Using the Tool
##############

In this section the basic operation of the tools provided by lib_audio_dsp is
described. This document takes the user through four scenarios of use,
illustrated by way of the included example `app_simple_audio_dsp_integration`,
which may be found in the `examples` directory in `lib_audio_dsp`. 

These scenarios are: 
- Building a pipeline 
- Tuning a pipeline 
- Simulating a pipeline
- Deploying pipeline code onto the xcore.

It is assumed that users have first completed the installation guide found in [TODO: HYPERLINK].
