This guide will cover the details of how the xcore DSP pipeline is generated from the Python description. This should
enable the reader to debug their pipeline when issues arise and understand the resource usage of a generated DSP

that they have created. The accompanying tool and component guides should be consulted for the basic process of using
this tool.
